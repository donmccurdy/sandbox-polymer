# Polymer Sandbox

Sandbox for [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) experiments.

I use [tapio/live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) for all of my quick development projects. To get started:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
cd my-project
live-server .
```

The project will open in your default browser, and reload when changes are detected.
